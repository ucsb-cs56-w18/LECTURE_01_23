* Setting us up for lab01

# Some things we want to learn how to do

OBVIOUSLY we are not going to discuss all of these in detail today.  Even 1-2 minutes on each topic would take almost the entire class period.    I'm trying to just lay out the territory.

Many (if not all) covered in the Rational Tutorial

* Obviously: basics of creating Java Class
   * private data members (attributes)
   * constructors (default, and with parameters)
   * getters and setters
   * `.toString`
   * `.equals` and `.hashCode`
* Using Github
* Using Ant 
    * Including some XML basics
* Setting up Javadoc for a private repo
* Using JUnit
* Using Maven
* Making ArrayLists of objects and sorting them
   * Using "natural sort" for objects that already implement Comparable
   * Making objects implement Comparable
   * Using Comparators for objects that don't yet implement Comparable
   * Using lambda expressions for Comparators (not yet in the textbook)

# Java Language Topics

* extends vs. implements (inheritance vs. interfaces)
* heap vs. stack
* lifetime of variables
* garbage collection

# Further down the road

* Exceptions
   * Checked vs. Unchecked
   * User defined exceptions
   * using try/catch, and using "throws"   
   * throw vs. throws
* GUIs
   * The old way: Swing (per your textbook)
   * The newer way: JavaFX (not in your textbook)
